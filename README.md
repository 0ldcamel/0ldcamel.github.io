# 0ld Camel's CS journey

My CS journey started in mid 2023 out of boredom from the COVID-19.

git is still a misterry. Today, it spits out this error message:  
```! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/0ldcamel/0ldcamel.github.io.git
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.```

After some Googling, I found this "solution"  

`git pull origin --rebase`
