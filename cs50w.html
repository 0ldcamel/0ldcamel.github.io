            <h2>Week 0 - HTML and CSS</h2>
            <div>
                Week 0 Lecture is well explained, lot of information though. However, Project 0 is not easy. Here are my notes:
                <h3>I'm Feeling Lucky</h3>
                I find this button <button>I'm Feeling Lucky</button> is the most challenging in problem 0.
                
                <p>This <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/176/discussion/2314189?comment=9874744">answer from Alex B.</a> is key, 
                    it gives clues to the solution but inn't giving away, so it's copied and pasted below:</p>
                <div class="emphasized">
                    There is a query string parameter that sets off the redirect for the "lucky" button. 
                    It's tricky to find because you don't see the url after redirect. The way to find it is to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>open Chrom dev tools</li>
                        <li>open Network tab</li>
                        <li>make a "lucky" search</li>
                    </ul>
                    One of the requests will be a 302 redirect. If you click on it, it will show you the query string 
                    parameters including the one you're looking for.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Image Search</h3>
                <p>This requires some close inspection of the query string in the URL.
                Initally I thought it was <i>&sclient=img</i> (at the end of URL) but it wasn't. 
                Next suspects were <i>&sca_esv=...</i> and <i>&sca_upv=1</i>, ...</p>

                <p>Keep trying, you'll eventually find it.</p>

                <p>If you really got stuck, try <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/176/discussion/4224030">this.</a>
                In this case, the CS50 Duck is too helpful, spilt out the full code. I am glad to figured it out before seeing that post.</p>
