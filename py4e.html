            <p>I am taking this course <a href="https://www.py4e.com/">Python for Everybody</a> 
                by <a href="https://www.dr-chuck.com/">Dr. Charles Severance</a>. Dr. Chuck is the Clinical Professor at the University of Michigan. 
                Dr. Chuck is teaching this course for free. </p>
            
                <p>It is amazing that this course is one of the most popular Python course in the world, with millions people enrolled. I think Dr. Chuck
            created this course with the smallest budget, he single handed the whole course, in his spare time, creating contents and teaching from home. </p>

            <p>As the name suggests, this is a "for every body" course, hence it's not as challenging as other courses from Harvard, Stanford or MIT.</p>
             
            <p>On a side note, Dr. Chuck has a series of free courses, that I intend to take after this course.</p>
