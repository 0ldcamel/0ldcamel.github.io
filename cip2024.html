            <h2>Week 0 - Onboarding</h2>
            <div>
                <p>I am excited to get accepted to <a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/cip4/studenthome">Stanford's Code in Place 2024.</a></p>
                <p>There is a well explained Orientation. Chris and Mehan are super friendly.
                There is a built in Forum too.</p>

            <h2>Week 1 - Welcome</h2>
            <p>Programming Karel is a lot of fun. Initially I thought Karel is a she, but Karel is actually a he, according to many of posts in the Forum.</p>
            <p>Attending the first Section is a bit nerve-racking. I realized that I needed Zoom to be installed on my decades old iMac, that runs on Ubuntu!.</p>
            <p>After some Googling, I got Zoom installed an an account registered. I think it works, including the camera, but sometimes my Section Leader and 
                probably many of fellow students did not understand what
            I said. I'd like to think it's my old hardware (iMac) is incompatible with the new app (Zoom) than my heavy accent.</p>
            <p>I still haven't been able to change the brackground on my video. Sorry for the mess.</p>
            <p>There is a nice surprise that my Section Leader is currently in Vietnam, where I am from.</p>

            <h2>Week 2 - Stepwise Refinement</h2>
            <div>
                I realy like the idea of stating <b>pre-condition</b> and <b>post-condition</b> in each function. It helps a lot. 
                <h3>Midpoint Karel</h3>
                <p>I was so releaved after resolving this challenge. I was a bit proud of myself too, I foolishly thought my solution is the only solution, or at least, 
                    it is one of the good solution. Turned out, it's not even close. There are so many different solutions.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>This is my<a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/cip4/forum?post=4d002d20-97c2-4587-a437-8a8de63655bf"> favourite and misterious solution</a>. 
                        I still don't know how <a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/cip4/user/MsS226IfzJVprTo9iiErG1bZwiN2">this guy</a> pulled it off. (* Note)</li>
                    <li>This is <a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/cip4/share/lnP9M8ko4XySM2FHyr4r">the best solution</a> in my opinion for its simplicity and elegance.
                        And not just that, it is the solution that I can understand and replicate.</li>

                </ol>
                <p>* Note: Joseph, a head TA has just sent an invite to <a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/cip4/forum?post=f022cff5-10c2-4b08-92f9-7c40456688fc">"ðŸŽ‰ Karel Workshop: 
                    Fill Karel and Midpoint Karel with Joseph ðŸŽ‰"</a>.</p>
                <p>I am so interested as the agenda includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fill Karel</li>
                    <li>Midpoint Karel on MxN worlds where M<=N (two ways)</li>
                    <li>(challenge) NxN Midpoint Karel <b>without beepers!</b> ðŸ¤”</li>
                </ul>
                I missed the live workshop and have to watch <a href="https://rb.gy/6h5qgh">the recording</a>.

                <h3>Python went to Mars!</h3>
                <p>As we getting an introduction to Python, it's excited to know the language has been used for space exploration!. Sky is the limit!
                </p>
                <p>On the other hand, I would say we are all missing Karen, Mars Weight isn't that challenging.</p>
                <p>My Section Leader posted Section 3 Bonus problem so here is <a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/cip4/share/uwEY39N9tFGdAypdytY4">my solution.</a> 
                    It will keep asking for valid weight and name of planet. My Calculator even suggests correct names for misspelled ones. </p>

            <div>
                <p>So far, Week 5 is the most exciting week. I have lots of fun with it. It started with Function 2.0, with parameters and 
                    return values, then countinued with graphics.

                <h3>Pyramid</h3>
                <p>I made a <a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/cip4/share/e1wh2qkKvXpGyejmKYSM">random colored pyramid</a>

                <h3>Memory Game</h3>
                <p>My Memory Game works quite well. I ran a test against Chris's own version and mine produces the same outputs but somehow
                    the auto grader still hate my code. 
                You can try it <a href=''>here</a>.
