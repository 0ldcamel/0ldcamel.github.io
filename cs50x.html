            <p>This is my first CS50 course, David Malan is a phenominal lecturer. The course is so hard. I later found out that it would be 
                easier to take CS50P first. Anyway, I managed to get it done in 16 weeks, during which, I had 3 weeks vacation in Europe.
                 Not bad for an old man.
            </p>
            <p>Looking back, this is one of the most exciting and challenging course I ever took. The MIT 6.001 is equally challenging but for me, it wan't 
                that exciting.
